When you first enable PallyPower and login everything will be blank. You’ll have to set your preferred Auras, and Seals.

Hover over the top button and spin your MOUSE WHEEL to cycle through your available Auras. A red colored button indicates that the chosen Aura isn’t active. Green obviously means that it is.

The second button is your Seals (center icon) and you can cycle through your available Seals the same way as the Auras. If you move your mouse to the left side of the button and hold SHIFT + MOUSE WHEEL to turn on/off Righteous Fury.

The third button is your Auto-Buff. Once all your Blessings are assigned this button will indicate the number of party/raid members who need to be buffed. This ONLY works out of combat. In combat you’ll have to look through the various pop outs under each class and look for players who aren’t buffed which will be clearly indicated. The timer on the Auto-Buff button represents the player with the lowest time remaining on their buff and clicking the button, again OUT of combat, will buff the player with the least amount of time remaining. LEFT CLICK buffs players with a GREATER blessing (15 min). RIGHT CLICK buffs players with a NORMAL blessing (5 min).

In most cases after a fresh install a class icon with your name in a pop out will not be present until the Blessing assignments are setup for the first time. You should see either a Red dot or a Green dot embedded along the left side of the PallyPower bar. You can hover over this dot and a tooltip will appear explaining its purpose. RIGHT CLICK will bring up the Blessing assignments.

The first column represents all the Paladins in your party/raid (every Paladin will have to also run PallyPower in order to make this happen). If you’re using PallyPower solo you’ll only see your name appear in this column with all your available Blessings, number of talent points for things like Improved Might and Wisdom, how many Symbol of Kings you have in your inventory etc. It’s self-explanatory. The next column are the assignments for which Aura each Paladin will be using followed by all the individual classes. You can either LEFT CLICK or MOUSE WHEEL though all the available Blessings or you can hold SHIFT + MOUSE WHEEL to assign the same Blessing to all classes.

Clear, Refresh – self-explanatory. The Auto-Assignment button is still a work in progress. I still get errors from time to time. I might have to spend some time to rethink the logic behind its function. It sort of works. Use at your own risk. Worst case, you’ll have to re-set all your assignments, but it won’t break PallyPower.

The Free-Assignment button allows you to give another Paladin the option to setup your assignments for you. Party/Raid leaders who are Paladins will automatically have this power and Raid Assists will also have the ability to setup assignments for an entire raid.

Optional Scenario: Warriors are typically Tanks but there are usually a fair number of DPS warriors as well. If you’re assigned to give Warriors Greater Blessing of Salvation you can override this by putting a NORMAL Blessing of Light on the Tanks. Simply hover over the Warrior class icon in your PallyPower bar and look for the tanks name. With your mouse cursor over the Tanks name MOUSE WHEEL to change their Blessing to something other than Salvation. Only the Paladin that is assigned to Salvation can make a manual change this way NOT the Class/Party/Raid Leaders. So, leaders remind your Paladins to make this change so the tanks don’t have to keep checking for Salvation to click off.

Current Issues/Known Quirks: The Blessing timers will disappear/reset to zero after Hunters Feign Death. The Blessing timers will clear if your client crashes or you RELOAD your UI. In both of the above cases the button coloring (Green or Red) will indicate if the player has an active Blessing.
